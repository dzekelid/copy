description: API to convert arbitrary, multi-lingual text into a human and seo-friendly-url.
  Clean URLs, URL slugs, user-friendly URLs and SEO-friendly URLs all pretty much
  refer to the same thing. The term Speaking URL originates from the Typo3 CMS system
  around 2004, although the idea of URLs being as human readable as possible stems
  from 1998 and 1999.
